I am currently an undergraduate student in School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), and I will pursue my Ph.D. in School of Information at Renmin University of China starting from Fall 2026 under the supervision of [Prof. Jing Zhang](https://xiaojingzi.github.io/).

I have conducted research on multimodal clustering and representation learning under the supervision of [Prof. Zhe Xue](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/xuezhe/zh_CN/index.htm). My work focuses on integrating contrastive learning, causal representation learning in multi-view settings.
