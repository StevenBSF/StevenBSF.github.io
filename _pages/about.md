I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), and I will pursue my Ph.D. in School of Information at Renmin University of China starting from Fall 2026 under the supervision of Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://xiaojingzi.github.io/).

I have conducted research on multimodal clustering and representation learning under the supervision of Prof. [Zhe Xue](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/xuezhe/zh_CN/index.htm). My work focuses on integrating contrastive learning, causal inference, and effective representation in multi-view settings.

I have collaborated with Dr. Yuankai Qi from Macquarie University on two first-author papers accepted at top conferences, including ACM MM 2025 (Oral, expected top 5%) and ICIC 2025 (Oral).
